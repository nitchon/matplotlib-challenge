Module 5 Challenge

## Description
    At its core, data science is truth-telling or story-telling. And growing up, the best stories always had pictures. Matplotlib, alone or in tandem with Pandas, allows you to tell a story with visuals in a variety of graphs. The assignment is an exercise in creating graphs using Matplotlib and Pandas as well as practice in statistics and observation analysis. The dataset is from a study of anti-cancer pharmaceuticals in mice diagnosed with skin cancer.

    In the repository, you will find the aformentioned dataset as well as a Jupyter notebook file with the final script. The script walks you through the collecting of summary statistics, creating bar graphs, pie charts, boxplots as well as line and scatter plots. The last cells of the notebook pertain to the Pearson correlation coefficient and linear regressions. The script can be used in various real-life scenarios taking advantage of the capabilities of Matplotlib and Pandas.
    
    
        
## Conclusions

Among the four most promising drug regimens, Ramicane and Capomulin illustrate smaller final tumor volumes. Ramicane slightly bests Capomulin in final tumor volumes. Illustrated in the boxplot below, Infubinol has one potential outlier that is below the lower extreme.

In the Summary Statistics table for tumor volume listed below, Ramicane has the smalled average tumor volume, while Ketapril has the largest average tumor volume.
    
When treated with Capomulin, the Pearson correlation coefficient between average tumor volume and weight is 0.84, indicating a strong positive correlation. When mouse weight increases, the tumor volume also increases. This may suggest that weight affects the effectiveness of the drug regimen.

Capomulin is effective in reducing tumor volume.

As illustrated in the bar graph, capomulin and Ramicane have the most timepoints out of all of the drug regimens in the study. More timepoints suggest either more mice were treated with these drug regimens or more mice survived for longer.

There is roughly an equal gender distribution among the mice in this study.
